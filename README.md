# Secure Coding Examples

Welcome to the Secure Coding Examples repository!

The repository contains the vulnerable and solutions for examples of secure coding practices bifurcated by their CWE enumerations and languages.

This is an attempt by [The Cyber Octet Team](https://cyberoctet.com) to share some of the best practices and solutions for secure coding.

Feel free to share your examples with us, update the examples, or contribute!
